# search-algorithms
Visualizing how search algorithms work in a grid by using the pygame library.

Currently implemented: A*, BFS, DFS.

How it works: Start search.py, left click the grid to place start position, right click for target position(s). Then click the desired search algorithm to the right of the grid to begin the search!

TODO: 
* Add an editing tool to make mazes and other obstacles
* Option to choose size of grid
* Add option to add walls randomly in the grid
* Fix the design
