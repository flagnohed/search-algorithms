# search-algorithms
Visualizing how search algorithms work in a grid by using the pygame library.

Currently implemented: A*, BFS, DFS.

How it works: Start search.py, left click the grid to place start position, right click for target position(s). Then click the desired search algorithm to the right of the grid to begin the search!

TODO: 
* Need to fix window size (current size is for my old screen)
* Option to choose size of grid
